# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a library management system, that was developed in Java, javascript, xhtml/css and postgreSQL as part of a student software project. 
I was mainly involved in implementing the business logic and the front-end. 
I have contributed to files, where my name (Helena Mei√üner) is mentioned in the authore section.
